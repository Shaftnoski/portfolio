   <h1>My Favorite Superheroes: A Semantic Webpage</h1>
   <h2>Marvel Heroes<h2>
   <p><em>Marvel Superhero comics are the best.</em><br>
      The storylines are more complex, and <u>often address real life social issues.</u>  The MCU is far superior to the DC films.  My favorite heroes are The X-Men, though the movies -previously produced by Fox- have traditionally been only decent.<p>

   <h3>DC Heroes (and Others)
   <p><q>DC Characters are good too, but the movies are rushed and badly written with lousy character development.</q>  Although, the animated movies and TV series they make are phenominal.</p>
   <blockquote> In summary, DC does great on TV but their live action movies are weak.</blockquote>
   <p>Marvel on the other hand produces gold regularly in all formats and have a vastly more interesting universe.<p>
